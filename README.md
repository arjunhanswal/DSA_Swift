# DSA_Swift
🔹 Core DSA Problems Every iOS Developer Should Practice
1️⃣ Arrays & Strings (Very High Priority)

Most iOS interview questions start here.

Problems

Reverse a string in-place

Find the first non-repeating character

Check if two strings are anagrams

Longest substring without repeating characters

Merge two sorted arrays

Move all zeros to the end

Rotate array by k steps

Why important for iOS

String handling

Memory efficiency

Swift Array, String, Substring behavior

2️⃣ HashMap / Dictionary

Used heavily in Swift (Dictionary).

Problems

Two Sum

Count frequency of characters

Find duplicates in an array

Group anagrams

Longest consecutive sequence

Swift Focus

Dictionary[key, default:]

Value vs reference behavior

3️⃣ Linked List (Medium Priority)

Used to test pointer logic.

Problems

Reverse a linked list

Detect cycle (Floyd’s algorithm)

Merge two sorted linked lists

Remove nth node from end

Interview Angle

Explains memory references

ARC & retain cycles discussion

4️⃣ Stack & Queue (Very Common)

Often related to UI/state handling logic.

Problems

Valid parentheses

Min Stack

Implement Stack using Array

Sliding window maximum

Queue using two stacks

5️⃣ Recursion & Backtracking

Used to check thinking depth.

Problems

Fibonacci (with memoization)

Generate all subsets

Permutations

Phone keypad combinations

6️⃣ Trees (Must-Know)

Important for system thinking.

Problems

Binary tree traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

Max depth of binary tree

Lowest common ancestor

Validate Binary Search Tree

Level order traversal

7️⃣ Sorting & Searching

Used to optimize logic.

Problems

Binary search

Search in rotated sorted array

QuickSort / MergeSort (conceptual)

Find kth largest element

8️⃣ Dynamic Programming (Interview Favorite)

Asked at senior level.

Problems

Climbing stairs

House robber

Longest increasing subsequence

Coin change

Edit distance (conceptual)
